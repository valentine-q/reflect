What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initizialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory where
the metadata of the tracked files are stored. I need to do it on order
Git can track the changes of my files and knows where to store
the information about it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only the files you want to add to
the commit. It is like a logical bundle. So the files in the
staging area are related to each other. It allows to have 
the files in the commit that are logically belongs to this commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?
The git status command shows you all the files that were modified.
If you want to have one commit per logical change you can add to the
staging area only the files that are related to this change and then
commit the changes. The staging area contains only the changes that
you are going to commit.
