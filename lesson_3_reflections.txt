When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when I want to share my code with other people or when I 
want to have access from multiple machines and always stay up-to-date.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because some of your changes could be just a part of a new feature and you would not want
to share it until it is finished. You may want to have control and to decide yourself
when you want to make your new feature public.
